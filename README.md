## Project Description
This project implements a tik-tac-toe 3x3 game. The game has two main components:

- **C++ Client**: Built in Visual Studio 2022, this component acts as the client that interacts with the server to play the game.
- **Arduino R3 Server**: Running on an Arduino IDE setup, the server handles game logic and player inputs for tik-tac-toe 3x3.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core game logic and client-side code
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Main development environment for C++
- **Arduino IDE**: Development environment for Arduino R3
- **Arduino Uno R3**: Hardware component acting as the game server
